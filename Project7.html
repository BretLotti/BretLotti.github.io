  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>SLA Priting</b></h1>
  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This is the first machine we did not get trained on the machine for the project. We uploaded our designs and had 
them printed for us. So my explanations are through second hand knowledge. One key differnce between SLA and FDM printing, is the material used. 
While FDM priting uses filament, which is a heated plastic. SLA printing uses a type of resin. 
SLA printing also requires more care as the liquid resin can cause rashes when exposed to skin. Also, while the build plate of an FDM printer is 
on the bottom and and object is created from the top. An SLA printer does the opposite and brings the build plate downwards and the resin is 
polymerized from the bottom. An object made through SLA printing is also somewhat soft after the print is finished and needs to be 
washed and then cured in order to completely finish a project.</p>



  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>My chosen Video and Pros/Cons</b></h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>I chose to use the "spinning ring" design video 
for my project. I just found this one the most interesting design to try and create. The biggest pro 
I would say this video has is that showed me how to create something I probably never would 
have thought of/figured out on my own. Now, by far the biggest con of this movie is the speed. The creator 
moves and talks so quickly, that it is very hard to follow along with the creator. I had to watch the video at slowed down speed 
and was constantly pausing in order to follow along. Though through a mix of trial and error, along with a lot of pausing. I was 
able to create my own ring with my own text design. </p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>New Skills</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>The first new skill I picked up was using the 
line tool in Fusion. As it was the basis of getting the ring design to work. For my other projects, I used the rectangle and circle tools, but never touched the 
line tool until now. Getting the hang of it took a little while and required some trial and error, but I 
eventually figured it out. </p>

    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>The next new tool I learned was "revolve". This is what actaully tunred the line 
    work into the ring the shape. I honestly don't have much else to say on the revolve tool. It revolved a sketch around a selected axis. And 
that is pretty much what I know about it.</p>

    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Next I learned to use was "Section Analysis"
    This allowed me to cut away a part of my design and look inside of it. This was very important as 
the spring is two parts that are interlocked, which is what allows it to spin. The section analysis tool 
allowed me to look and see if the two parts were created correctly. </p>

<div>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>To make my design more comfortable and ring shaped.
I used the "fillet tool". This allowd me to curve the edges of the ring and the interlocking pieces to help it spin. 
That's really the main focus of the tool. Smooth edges and other parts of designs made in Fusion.
</p>

    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Finally, I learned to add text to my designs inside Fusion. When I made my 
    desk organizer, I didn't use the text feature in Fusion at all. However, the ring required me to use the text tool in order 
to add text to my design. I kept my text rather simple and just made it my name. I am pretty happy with how it came out 
and I think it fits with the size of the ring really well.</p>
