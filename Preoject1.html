<!--First Paragraph-->
  <p style="font-size: 150%;" width = 10> The first step of this project was setting up a Gitup Acount and Gitbash.
Now, I have a windows computer, so I ran into some strange issues with the gitbash terminal being unable to idenfity me.
Which is not something I've seen with the MAC users I have talked too. This issue required me to go into my powershell
and push my email and user name through there. After that, setting up the site was as easy as following the video on the 
class website. </p>

<!--Paragrpah 2-->
<p style="font-size: 150%;" width = 10> After that I went looking for a website template. After some browwsing, I found a template
I really like called "Interior Design" that a side bar function that I really liked. Thus the basis for my site is that template I have
edited much of to really make it my own. The hardest part of this process was setting my site up in a 
way that was well formatted and was appealing to look at/navigate.</p>
