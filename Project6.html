  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This weeks project was to design and print 
a pot using using an FDM printer that can fit into the desk organizer from the last project.</p>


<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>FDM Printers</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>FDM printers can be thought of as almost high tech glue guns. 
They take a design from and STL file and super height a filiment that the design will be 
made of. After the heating process is done, it begins to create the physical object. This printer 
goes layer,by layer, until the object is complete. This is a slow process that can take several hours. My pot alone took almost 10 hours to complete.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Prusa Slicer</b></h1>
    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Prusa Slicer is one of the programs I used 
    during the creation of my pot. It can be seen as almsot a simulation of the FDM printer.
It will show you an exact cpoy of the the bed of the FDM printer as well as what your design will 
look like as it starts to print. It also provides helpful information, such as the amount of time the 
print will take, the size of object on the bed, and if you need any supports. The FDM printer cannot
create in thin air, so parts of an object that are hanging off, or not on the bed, need supports in order 
to print. </p>

<!--Fusion 360-->
<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Fusion 360</b></h1>
<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This whole Project started in Fusion 360. I started by creating the base of 
my pot that would fit into the desk organzier. This involved setting the dimensions correctly to make sure 
it would fit after being created. I then created a rounded body with a squared off top. I messed around with a couple 
design ideas, but ended up liking the rounded body with a sqaure top the most. I then added some "wings", for lack of a better 
word, to make my design stand out a bit more. The final step was hollowing it out, since it was supposed to be a pot after all.
 After I was happy with the design it was simply a matter of exporting it as an STL.</p>
