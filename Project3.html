  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Project Details</b></h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This weeks project was to design and laser cut
a box(with a hinge). That also had our initals rastered onto the box.</p>


  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Box Design Process</b></h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>The first step was to design a box in a 
generator and save it as an svg. I used a template I found online where the hinge used parametric kerfing.
I then saved this file as an SVG and began to edit it in Adobe Illustrator. Adding my initals
that would then be burned into the design by the laser cutter. The hardest part here was picking 
the font I wanted to use for my initals. After that, it was simply placing the letters where I wanted 
and giving them an outline.   </p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Box Cutting</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Next came the actual cutting of the box. This was done on a
sheet of plywood. My box ended up being about 4"x4". After getting the design
imported to the glowforge app. I simply had to wait for the machine to cut out and etch 
my box out of the board. This was about 10 minutes of standing next to the laser cutter. Making sure
there was no fires or issues with the machine. After that, it was simply taking my pieces
from the machine and putting them together. This was the hardest part for me. It took me a little while
to get all the pieces together to actually create the box. I eventually figured it out, but I forgot to 
take any pictures of the pre-assembled pieces. Overall, the whole process was not very hard and getting the whole 
box together was really cool.</p>
