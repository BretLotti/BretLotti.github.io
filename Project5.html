  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This weeks project was use the shaper machine to 
deisgn and cut out a desk organizer using the CNC Router.</p>


<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Design Phase</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10> For the design of the desk organizer, we used the program 
Fusion 360. This allowed me to create both an outline and full render of what the desk organizer would 
look like after it was actaully cut. The organizer needed to have a ring cut out for a future project, 3 additonal 
slots for other objects, and Finally, some sort of text. I simply used my initials for this requirment. 
I had to make a design using Fusion 360(a 3D modeling software). This process included creating the organizer from 
scratch(Images below) and the creating a render of it. This was to get an idea of what the final product would look like once 
cut. The design was then brought over to Adobe Illustrator in order to create an image that the 
shaper was capable of using for the cut.

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>The Shaper</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>The shaper is the machine used to create the desk organizer. 
It takes a design as an .svg file and displays how the image will apear on the wood you're cutting using the shaper screen. It's important to have the wood you're cutting 
secured down with both screws and double sided tape. As the wood should not be able to move or shift in any way while doing a cut.
Now, the shaper is capable of a few different kinds of cuts. For this project I used on-line cuts and pocket cuts. On-line is exactly 
what is sounds like. The shaper will cut on a line. While a pocket cut will cut out a pocket in the wood. When making a cut, for the most part, we are guiding the shaper 
along the cut. This can be quite an upper body workout, as you are cutting into a solid block of wood. There is a lot of safety involved in using the machine.
You have to make sure the vacume atttached to the shaper is working, you must be wearing goggles and ear protection, and finaly, 
nothing can be hanging over the shaper. Such as hair or hoddie strings. </p>
