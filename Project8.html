  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>My design process was actually pretty simple and not 
too much of a struggle to do. By this point I've used Illustrator enough to the point 
designing something isn't too hard. I decided to go with a design based on a video game 
I have been playing called Destiny 2. I knew pretty quickly what type of design I wanted and 
the text to go with it. This was honestly not too hard once I had a design in mind. With the whole process taking under an 
hour to fully complete.  </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Box Design</b></h1>

    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This proved to be much more challenging 
    than the design of the arcylic. I knew the basic outline of what I needed to have, but creating a design 
  that would work from scratch proved to be challenging. After lots of trial and error, along with many, many 
measurement changes. I had a design I was convinced would work. I had started with a basic box with a hole in the side. 
I then added a second "shelf" to help keep the light piece and electronics secured. I was very happy with the design and thought for sure 
it would work. However, when the print was complete, the box was the slightest bit too small for the wodden pieces to fit 
correctly.  </p>
