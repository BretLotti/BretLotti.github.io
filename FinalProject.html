  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Project Description</b></h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>For this final project, I've been working with a group of two other people. We will be creating a model of a 
roller coaster that exists in world where physics work differntly than our own. To do this, we will be making the coaster work as if it is in a 3D torus. This 
basically means that the coaster will work by PACMAN rules. Where once the "cart" hits one end of model, it will appear out another end. To do this, we will use 
LED light stripes programmed to move one pixel at a time to simualte a cart moving along a rail. While this is a pretty ambitious project, we have split the work 
between the 3 of us in a way that gives us a rather even disribution of work.</p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>My job</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>My job is handling the creation of the box in which our coaster will be contained, along with many of the aesthetic pieces. These pieces include 
the "coaster" sign and various other elements to give it the apperance and feel of a roller coaster. This was largely done using the Glowforge to cut and engrave the 
various pieces and parts of the box. For the prototype(Put together below), I used wood and simple designed pieces to a physical idea of what the project will look like, without 
using more expersive/less abundent material.</p>
