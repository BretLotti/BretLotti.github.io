  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Project Details</b></h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This weeks project was to design a logo
    for a fake company in adobe Illustrator and then embrioder said design onto a draw
    string bag.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Logo Design Process</b></h1>

    <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>I knew almost instanly that I wanted to have my logo
    and fake company name be based around skateboarding. My first step here was to create
a name for this skateboad company. I then thought of the word "wicked" which is slang most
popularly used in New England states such as RI(Where I am from) and Mass. The word also fits 
nicely into what is generally considered to be "Skater Slang". So I had the name "Wicked Skateboards". The rest of the design came pretty 
easily. I used a font that had a Halloween/Skater look to it for the company name. Orignally, the design was to use black thread for the 
text and character, but the black thread refused to work. So I had to use a different color, which ended up being red. I then used orange for the 
framing device since the idea was for it to be a pumpkin.

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>The Embroidery/Machine Struggles</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>This has by far been the most frustrating project for this class 
  thus far. The machine was broken for a few days. So I could not schedule a time to get in the lab 
  to make the bag with my design. And when I managed to get to the lab after the machine 
  had been fixed. I was running into issues where the machine kept saying that it was not 
  threaded properly, despite the fact I was certain I was threading it correctly. And there was no one in the lab was experienced
  enough on the machine to help me trouble shoot the issue. So after two hours of trying. I had to throw in the towel and 
  come back another day. After that, I came back a few days later and learned the black thread I was trying to use 
  was just not working with the machine and I had to use another color in my design. So, after a week of issues, I was finally 
  able to get my design embroidered onto the fabric. However, I ran out of my booked time and needed to pack up 
for a training to take place. I then came in a few days later and was able to stitch my bag together. Finally completing the project(Thankfully). </p>
