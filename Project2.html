  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Vinyl Cutting in Digital Fabrication</b></h1>
  <p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10> First off, I would most definitely consider 
vinyl cutting to be part of digital fabrication.The process of vinyl cutting involves creating
a digital design that is then created physically using the vinyl cutter.From what I understand,
that whole process of digital design to physical creation is exactly what digital fabrication is. So it would be
odd to aruge vinyl cutting does not fit under the digital fabrication umbrella.</p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Vector Vs. Raster Images</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Raster images are much more common than vector
images as they are pixel based and the types of images we see everytime we take a picture. 
Image file types such as jpgs, pngs, and gifs are all types of raster images. Vector images on the other
hand are much less common. Being defined using math and vector software. You will
largely see vector images used for things such as engraving and vinyl cutting. Like in this project, 
where we had a jpg image that we then made into a vector image in order to cut out the design.  </p> 

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Project Intro</b></h1>

<!--2nd paragraph-->
<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10> The assigment was to create a design for a 
shirt that was then cut using the vinyl cutter. The design had to be at least 4"x4" and
have a related qoute of at least 15 characters. </p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b> Design Process</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10> The first step was creating a design uisng Adobe Illustrator.
This proved to be one of the hardest steps for me as I could not for the life of me think of a design that
I wanted to do. Eventually I settled on the idea of doing a Game of Thrones themed shirt
(one of my favorite tv shows). I knew that I wanted to do the wolf crest of House Stark from the show.
Which is the head of a wolf. As for my text, I used the title of the ruler of the Stark's hold from the show. I came up with two
possible designs I liked. Though I eventually went with the simple "The King In The North".

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Cutting and Printing</b></h1>

<!--Paragrpah 3-->
<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>Now for the really fun part. Printing out, cutting, and 
    applying the image to the shirt. This first required getting the cutting machine ready. Different types of
vinyl require different levels of force. For example, the attire vinyl we used for this project
required 102g of force.   </p>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10> After the machine cuts the design into a sheet of vinyl. It's time to peel and cut away the 
extra vinyl that is not part of the image we want on the shirt. This was a fairly slow 
process because I had pretty styled font and many smaller parts that I did not want
to peel off on accident. </p>

<h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Heat Pressing and Trouble</b></h1>

<p style = "font-size: 150%" width = 10>The final step is placing the design on the shirt and 
pressing it using the heat press. At this point, I had decided the back of my shirt was the 
best place for my design. This is also where I ran into some trouble. I used the heat press exactly
as I was supposed to, but the vinyl had a hard time sticking. Not even a lab worker knew why my
vinyl was not pressing correctly(Shout out to John for the help!). After letting the shirt cool and very carefully removing
the plastic. My design was pressed onto the shirt. However, some letters were not holding well and I lost two tiny
details that can hardly be seen. With that being said, I think it was a rather sucessful first attempt
at vinyl cutting and applying a design to a shirt!  </p>
